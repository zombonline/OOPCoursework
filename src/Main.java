/*
Coursework Submission (Exercises)
IS52059B: Object-oriented Programming (2024-25)
Computing, Goldsmiths

Instructions:
Fill in the provided .java class files with your solutions so that all tests in main() run successfully and the program exits on its own. Read the comments at the start of the provided files for any special instructions. Note that if the original problem statement requested you to print information to the console as part of the solution, that is no longer necessary. The only exception to this is the exercise 'Enter the Data'. You are welcome to comment out sections of main() to verify individual solutions, but your final submission should leave main() in its original form unless noted otherwise.
